Perceptron learning algorithm in Python3

The perceptron is extremely important in the neural network world.
A lot of courses focus on MLPs - Multi Layer Perceptrons, which are used frequently with an activation function like the popular ReLU. But this is important to learn,
and the derivation of the perceptron algorithm is very interesting as well: https://leimao.github.io/blog/Perceptron-Convergence-Theorem/, which links to a proof from Prof Jaakkola from MIT. <br><br>
In this project, the perceptron learning algorithm will be used with a popular dataset named 'solar'.
This is heavily inspired from this:

Hope this is enlightening.
